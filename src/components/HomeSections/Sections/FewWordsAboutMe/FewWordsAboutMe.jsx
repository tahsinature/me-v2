        I'm a Jakarta based Software Engineer. A passionate and pragmatic programmer with 2 years of professional experience, specializing in full-stack development using modern & robust technologies.
        Sometimes I work on things I find interesting, or things I think other people might find interesting. Itâ€™s nice when those things overlap.
